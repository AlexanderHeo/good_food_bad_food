      <h5>Thank you for downloading this app! This app
        is for people who need to track their diet due
        to a disease.
      </h5>
      <h5>There are many diseases that affect what you are
        able to eat. Eating something that does not
        agree with you can result in anything from
        minor discomfort to a hospital visit.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        You can use GFBF to track what you eat,
        then come back and enter how it made you feel.
        This way you can keep a log of foods you can eat
        and foods that make you feel bad.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        By logging everything you ate and it&apos;s affect,
        you will be able to avoid foods that don&apos;t sit well with
        you in the future.
