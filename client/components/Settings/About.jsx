				After an amazing career behind the bar as a mixologist, I decided to change careers and went into tech. I loved the internet, already knew a little HTML and CSS, so decided to apply to a web dev boot camp. And I got accepted! Yay!
      </p>
      <p className='paragraph'>
				Halfway through the program, I got really ill and ended up in the E.R. for a few days. After dozens of pokes, prods, and CT scans, the diagnosis was stress induced gastrointestinal motility issues. Basically, the food was not moving properly through my body, and I would have to watch my diet.
      </p>
      <p className='paragraph'>
				So I decided to create this app, to track all the food I eat, and report whether it was good to eat, or if it caused a flair up of my illness. With this app, I am now able avoid Bad Foods, unless I&apos;m really craving a pepperoni pizza ðŸ˜œ
      </p>
      <p className='paragraph'>
				I&apos;m adding more features and CSS animation all the time, so please come back often to see my progress. Or if you need, feel free to create an account and use this app! Drop me a line if you find a bug, or have an idea for a feature.
